// Aicent Stack | RPKI (Resource Public Key Infrastructure) 
// Domain: http://rpki.com
// Purpose: Parallel tensor watermarking & sub-ms pathogen isolation.
// Specification: RFC-003 Standard (Active).
// License: Apache-2.0 via Aicent.com Organization.
//! # RFC-003: RPKI Immune Pipeline
//! 
//! The `rpki` crate implements the biological defense layer of the Aicent Stack.
//! It ensures the integrity of the "Data Soul" by treating every inbound 
//! RTTP Pulse Frame as a potential antigen that must be verified at wire speed.
//!
//! ### Core Immunity Logic:
//! - **Parallel Tensor Watermarking**: In-band cryptographic steganography for AI manifolds.
//! - **ROA-Chain Attestation**: Route Origin Authorization evolved for AID fingerprints.
//! - **Quarantine-in-Flight**: Surgical isolation of malicious nodes in <300µs.
//! - **Swarm Shield**: Collective hive-mind immunity and cross-attestation (RFC-006).

#![deny(missing_docs)]
// SAFETY: Unsafe code is strictly constrained to zero-copy memory mapping 
// from the RTTP network spine. Cryptographic operations are mathematically safe.
